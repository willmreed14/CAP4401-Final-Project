# Facial Recognition in MATLAB using Deep Learning
William Reed's Final Project - CAP 4401 Digital Image Processing

## How to Use
1. Download and unzip the project folder either from this repo or from the canvas submission.
2. Open 'Reed_Facial_Recognition.mlx' in MATLAB.
3. Ensure the MATLAB Deep Learning Toolbox is installed on your machine.
4. Ensure the working directory in MATLAB is set to the (unzipped) project folder 'Reed_Facial_Recognition'.
5. Run the Live Script. The dataset is already properly organized for use within the project folder for your convenience!
